# Rust Programming Language
The Rust Programming Language Book

## Notes
- Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.
- Create a project using cargo new.
- Build a project using cargo build.
- Build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
- Build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
- cargo build --release to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in target/release instead of target/debug. The optimizations make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile.
- Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use.
